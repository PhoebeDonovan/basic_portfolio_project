                <h3>About Phe & Rogs</h3>
                <p>Rogs and I have been together for many years now but our relationship was fairly new when we had the 
                    crazy idea to hike in th footsteps of Sir Edmond Hilary. The year was 2017 and we were setting out 
                    on the adventure of a lifetime!! Our first ever hiking holiday and in Nepal of all places.</p>
                <p>Rogs and I had never done any serious hiking, sure we went on walks here and there but only a few hours 
                    at a time and never with a day bag let alone overnight stays! But we were young and full of 
                    adventurous spirit. So on a whim we decided we were going to hike to base camp on the Nepalese side of 
                    Mt Everest. Why not?</p>
                <p>We spent 6 months or so training with various forms of cardio, endurance and strength training. I started
                    eating vegan to account for the food we would have available to us (as well as for ethical and health reasons - 
                    still going strong today). We kitted ourselves out with hiking bags, sleeping bags, appropriate clothing, 
                    hiking packs, medication in case of infections or altitude sickness - you name it we had it. We decided to hike
                    unguided, something which I was nervouse about seeing as I have virtually no sense of direction but I trusted Rogs 
                    navigational skills and rightfully so!</p>

                <h3>Future thinking</h3>
                <p>Although we loved being indepent on our hike we met some amazing guides along the way and we look forward to employing
                their services for our next Nepalese hiking adventure! Their knowledge of the areas history and culture adds even more
                colour to the yourney as well as getting to enjoy their commpany, exchanging stories and playing local games in the evenings was
                a highlight for us.</p>
